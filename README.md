# Usage

Run `downgrade.bat` (NOT as Administrator - WinFlash64 should request admin on its own). The system will reboot and flash the BIOS region on your device. Voila! You're ready to run 1vyrain.

**NOTE:** Neither this tool nor 1vyrain will modify your EC. You are safe to flash your EC with the battery or keyboard mod at any time as long as you are on a version compatible with the EC mod (check compatibility [here](https://github.com/HeiderJeffer/thinkpad-ec#compatibilty-warning)). Both IVprep and 1vyrain will only modify the BIOS region! You can safely use 1vyrain to update to the latest BIOS without losing your other mods!
